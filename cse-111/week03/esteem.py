# 06 Team Activity: Troubleshooting Functions

"""
As a team, write a Python program named esteem.py that implements the Rosenberg self-esteem scale. Your program must ask the user to respond to each of the ten statements with D, d, a, or A which mean strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly agree. Your program must compute the score for each answer and sum and display the person's total score. You should think about how you will separate this program into functions before you begin writing the program.

Core Requirements
    1. Your program prints the introductory text as shown in the Testing Procedure section below.
    2. Your program prints each of the ten statements and gets a response from the user.
    3. Your program computes the score for each response and sums all the scores and displays the total score.
