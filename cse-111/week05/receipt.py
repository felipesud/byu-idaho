Assignment
During this milestone, you will write half of a Python program named receipt.py that prints to the terminal window a receipt for a customer's grocery order. Specifically, by the end of this milestone, your program must contain at least these two functions:

1. main
2. read_dict
and must read and process these two CSV files:

-> The products.csv file is a catalog of all the products that the grocery store sells.
-> The request.csv file contains the items ordered by a customer.
